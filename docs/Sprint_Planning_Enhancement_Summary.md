## üöÄ Continuous Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Database Foundation (Weeks 1-2) - CRITICAL
**Priority: Immediate Implementation Required**

#### New Tables to Create:
```sql
-- 1. Epics for issue hierarchy
CREATE TABLE epics (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status ENUM('Planning', 'In Progress', 'Done', 'Cancelled'),
  total_story_points INT DEFAULT 0,
  completed_story_points INT DEFAULT 0,
  target_date DATE,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 2. Issue dependencies for blocking relationships
CREATE TABLE issue_dependencies (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  issue_id INT NOT NULL,
  depends_on_issue_id INT NOT NULL,
  dependency_type ENUM('blocks', 'is_blocked_by', 'relates_to'),
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 3. Sprint metrics for velocity tracking
CREATE TABLE sprint_metrics (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  sprint_id INT NOT NULL,
  planned_points INT DEFAULT 0,
  completed_points INT DEFAULT 0,
  velocity_score DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0,
  team_size INT DEFAULT 0,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 4. Individual team member capacity
CREATE TABLE team_member_capacity (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  sprint_id INT NOT NULL,
  available_hours DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 40.0,
  story_points_capacity INT DEFAULT 10,
  capacity_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 100.0
);
```

#### Enhanced Issues Table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE issues 
ADD COLUMN epic_id INT NULL,
ADD COLUMN parent_id INT NULL,
ADD COLUMN rank INT DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN acceptance_criteria TEXT,
ADD COLUMN business_value INT DEFAULT 0;
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced APIs (Weeks 3-4) - HIGH PRIORITY

#### New API Endpoints:
1. **GET /api/v1/projects/:projectId/velocity** - Historical velocity data
2. **GET /api/v1/issues/:issueId/dependencies** - Issue dependency tracking
3. **POST /api/v1/issues/:issueId/dependencies** - Create dependencies
4. **GET /api/v1/projects/:projectId/epics** - Epic management
5. **PUT /api/v1/ai/projects/:projectId/sprint-plan** - Enhanced sprint planning

#### Enhanced AI Prompt (6,000+ characters):
```javascript
// Include historical velocity, dependencies, epics, and individual capacities
buildEnhancedSprintPlanningPrompt(sprintData) {
  const { 
    issues, sprintGoal, capacity, duration, teamMembers,
    historicalVelocity, dependencies, epics, individualCapacities
  } = sprintData;
  
  // Comprehensive prompt with velocity analysis, dependency management,
  // epic progress tracking, and individual workload distribution
}
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Frontend (Weeks 5-6) - MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### New UI Components:
1. **Backlog Management Interface** - Drag & drop functionality
2. **Velocity Dashboard** - Historical charts and trends
3. **Dependency Visualization** - Network graph of issue relationships
4. **Epic Progress Tracking** - Epic completion status and roadmaps
5. **Team Capacity Planning** - Individual member capacity settings

### Phase 4: AI & ML Enhancement (Weeks 7-8) - HIGH PRIORITY

#### Advanced AI Features:
1. **Machine Learning Integration** - Story point prediction based on historical data
2. **Advanced Risk Assessment** - Multi-factor risk analysis with probability scoring
3. **Workload Distribution** - Intelligent assignment based on skills and capacity
4. **Success Prediction** - Sprint outcome prediction with confidence intervals

## üéØ Critical Business Logic Gaps

### 1. Incomplete Backlog Analysis
**Current**: Limited to 30 issues
**Required**: Complete backlog with filtering and search
**Impact**: AI cannot make optimal selections from full context

### 2. Missing Historical Context
**Current**: No velocity tracking
**Required**: 3-6 sprints of historical data for accurate capacity planning
**Impact**: Capacity recommendations lack data-driven foundation

### 3. No Dependency Management
**Current**: Issues planned without considering blockers
**Required**: Dependency resolution and critical path analysis
**Impact**: Sprint plans may be unrealistic due to blocking issues

### 4. Limited Team Context
**Current**: Basic team member list
**Required**: Individual capacities, skills, and availability
**Impact**: Workload distribution is not optimized

## üìä Performance Metrics & Success Criteria

### Current Performance:
- ‚úÖ API Response Time: < 3 seconds
- ‚úÖ AI Processing Time: < 15 seconds
- ‚úÖ UI Load Time: < 2 seconds
- ‚úÖ Mobile Responsiveness: 100% compatible

### Target Improvements:
- üéØ Sprint Plan Accuracy: 85%+ (measured against actual completion)
- üéØ User Adoption: 90%+ of teams using AI recommendations
- üéØ Velocity Prediction: ¬±10% accuracy
- üéØ Risk Identification: 80%+ of actual risks predicted

Frontend input : 
1. select sprint start and end date 
2. Enter story points overall 
3. Paste all your tasks. keep them in numberd format. after each task in the bracket write priority if you want to explicitely or AI will decide itself (Critical/high/medium/low)
4. Clikcs "Suggest Sprint Plan"

AI will give response in such a way that What you need for creating a sprint and issues for that sprint.

In current scenario while we creating a spring  we take  Sprint Name , Sprint Goal , Start Date, End Date, Capacity (Story Points) as inputs 
For creating issue we take Issue type(Task, Bug, Story, Epic), Priority (P1/P2/P3/P4), Title, Description, Story Points, Assignee, Original Estimate hours as inputs. 

In response from AI we shall  get a JSON object with following details such that we can create a sprint and issues for that sprint. Note we will send this data to frontend. We will keep these fields editable. Once User clicks on create Sprint 

AI shall generate the JSON object as per the databasse tables of sprints and issues.

Sprint Name (name)
Sprint Goal (goal)
Start Date (start_date)(AI will receive start date from user)
End Date (end_date) (AI will receive end date from user)
Capacity Story Points (capacity_story_points) (AI will receive story points from user)


For each issue we shall get 
Issue type(Task, Bug, Story, Epic)
Priority (P1/P2/P3/P4)
Title
Description
Story Points
Assignee
Original Estimate hours
