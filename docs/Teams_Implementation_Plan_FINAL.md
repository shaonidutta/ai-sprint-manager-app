ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN team_name VARCHAR(255) NULL;
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN team_description TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN team_visibility ENUM('Private', 'Organization', 'Public') DEFAULT 'Private';
```

**Option B: Create Dedicated Teams Model**
```sql
-- New standalone teams table
CREATE TABLE teams (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  owner_id INT NOT NULL,
  visibility ENUM('Private', 'Organization', 'Public') DEFAULT 'Private',
